# Privacy Policy
The Unigram Mobile App stores your chat messages and all your personal data on your mobile device and sends and receives your data (phone number, messages (e.g. sharing a location) and some settings) from and to Telegram services, so have a look at [their privacy policy](https://telegram.org/privacy) at [https://telegram.org/privacy](https://telegram.org/privacy).
Be aware that location sharing services may use a Foursquare Telegram bot to find known locations nearby and show them in the share location view. ([See: tdlib](https://core.telegram.org/tdlib/docs/classtd_1_1td__api_1_1venue.html))
