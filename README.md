Thanks to the [Universal Windows Platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/whats-a-uwp), Unigram can run on any Windows 10 device (PC, smartphones, Xbox One, Holo Lens and Surface Hub), integrated with almost all the new Windows features, it provides a seamless and consistent user experience.
In agreement with the Unigram author, this fork continues to support Windows 10 Mobile smartphones, whereas the original Unigram stopped supporting them at the end of 2019. However, Unigram Mobile is exclusive to the mobile platform. Please use for other platforms the [original Unigram](https://github.com/UnigramDev/Unigram).
