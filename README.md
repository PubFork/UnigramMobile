The Telegram client optimised for the Windows 10 Mobile platform.

* [Download from the Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NSD4T15QLFX)
* [Telegram Group](https://t.me/UnigramMobile)

Thanks to the [Universal Windows Platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/whats-a-uwp), Unigram can run on any Windows 10 device (PC, smartphone, Xbox One, Holo Lens and Surface Hub), integrated with almost all the new Windows features, it provides a seamless and consistent user experience.
In agreement with the Unigram author, this fork continues to support Windows 10 Mobile smartphones, whereas the original Unigram stopped supporting them at the end of 2019. However, official Unigram Mobile releases in the Microsoft Store are exclusive to the mobile platform. Please use for other platforms the [original Unigram](https://github.com/UnigramDev/Unigram).

Unigram Mobile has 18 built-in languages. But you can create your own translation or use a translation others created.

Unigram Mobile has access to unlimited translation packs utilizing the Telegram translations platform.

If you wish to translate it to your language, you can do that [here](https://translations.telegram.org/en/android/), since Unigram Mobile uses the same translations as the official Telegram app for Android.

However, Unigram Mobile specific terms do not utilize the Telegram translation platform and may be translated on another platform [here](https://poeditor.com/join/project/Mes6DA3bhK).
