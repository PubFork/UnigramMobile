# Unigram Mobile

Unigram Mobile is a Telegram Messenger client optimised for Windows 10 Mobile. It is a fork of the [original Unigram app](https://github.com/UnigramDev/Unigram). For desktop support use the [original Unigram app](https://unigramdev.github.io/).

Unigram Mobile aims to support the latest Telegram features on Windows 10 Mobile. Because of time constraints the main developer might need months for the next release. If you are impatient, you might want to participate in the beta program or help developing features. Both are very much appreciated. Use [GitHub](https://github.com/hihain/UnigramMobile) for creating pull requests for reviews of your code changes or reporting issues. Join the [Unigram Mobile group](https://t.me/UnigramMobile) on Telegram for support and find the link to the private beta group in the group description.
